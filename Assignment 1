  <h2>Junior, IT</h2>
  <p1>Hello, I am a Junior here at Mizzou and I am an IT major. I am also a cadet in the Army ROTC program.
  I am from St. Louis and have lived there my whole life. I originally went to college for baseball my freshman
  year but transfered to Mizzou last year. Favorite movie I have seen recently was probably the new Top Gun,
  and I have seen it 3 times so far
